# STEAM_VIETNAM_SUBMISSION

Dear Steam Vietnam,

Instead of writing down the function description of the website application, I have made a video to quickly demonstrate what my basic website application could do at this moment.
Here is the link to the demonstration video: 

The reason for why my website application is very rusty because Javascript and bootstrap is new to me, even though I used to work on two websites but they are both static (HTML and CSS). During the last week, I have had only 16 hours to learn bootstrap, javascript and work on building the project. Since the deadline is 28th, I try to submit the best product I have done until now.

I hope to receive STEAM feedback on the application. Furthermore, I am still keeping on improvig the website application features to make them more stable and dymanic.

Sincerely,
